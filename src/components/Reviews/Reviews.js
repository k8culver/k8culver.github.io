                    encourages quality work... 
                    I often learned from her creative approach, and trusted her to ensure that the users of our applications had a great experience.

                    When given incomplete requirements, she identifies this and seeks to define the problem. 
                    She will collaborate with her colleagues and use her own strengths in problem solving and design to find a solution."'
